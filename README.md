# Rainbow six Basic prediction
This project was deisnged to do a couple of things:
  1. Be able to predict based of a trainset built by myself
  2. Do it with a limted set of stats to simulate being a team with no support staff
  3. see if it was actually feasable
  
## Types of prediction
this program uses ML .NET model builder to predict a Win and Kost of an individual player
the result prediction is not very accurate and is not much better than a coin toss imo, but its fun to play around with I guess
the kost prediction was around 70% accurate, which isnt great but bearing in mind its only using stats that come from what you can get in game, i.e. Kills,Deaths,Rounds player, Result, and Map.

## INSTALL
to use the program atm you need to:
1. put the prediction folder on your C drive
2. Run the exe in the netcoreapp folder
